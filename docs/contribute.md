## A Few Tips for Writing Documentation
We are always learning how to write better documentation for everyone.


#### Informative and friendly
Feel free to write in a casual tone, we're all humans(except for the snake bots we build). Just don't forget: Being informative and presenting information in a clear and thoughtful manner is the most friendly act of all.

#### Avoid "easy", "simple", or "just..."
Whether something is easy depends on how much experience you have with the subject and we want our documentation be as inclusive as possible. It can be very frustrating for a reader to disagree with the documentation, so please watch out for these words!

#### Use Descriptive Headers and Sub-headers
Some people read every word, but others just want to scan for the information they need. Descriptive headers help anyone scanning the document by grouping information. Organizing your thoughts by starting with an outline of descriptive headers can also be a great way to start writing!
